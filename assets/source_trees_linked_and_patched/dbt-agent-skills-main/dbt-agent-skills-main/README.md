# dbt Agent Skills

A curated collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for working with dbt. These skills help AI agents understand and execute dbt workflows more effectively.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently.

## How They Work

These skills are **not** slash commands or user-invoked actions. Once installed, the agent automatically loads the relevant skill when your prompt matches its use case. Just describe what you need in natural language and the agent handles the rest. See [skill invocation control](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#control-who-invokes-a-skill) for more details.

## What's Included

- **Analytics engineering**: Build and modify dbt models, write tests, explore data sources
- **Semantic layer**: Create metrics, dimensions, and semantic models with MetricFlow
- **dbt Mesh**: Work with multi-project setups, cross-project refs, model governance (contracts, versions, access)
- **Platform operations**: Troubleshoot job failures, configure the dbt MCP server
- **Migration**: Move projects from dbt Core to the Fusion engine

## Installation

### Claude Code

Add the dbt skills marketplace and install the plugins:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills

# Install the dbt skills (analytics engineering, semantic layer, testing, etc.)
/plugin install dbt@dbt-agent-marketplace

# Install the migration skills (typically a one-off — not needed for every session)
/plugin install dbt-migration@dbt-agent-marketplace
```

### Compatible Agents

These skills work with AI agents that support the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## Available Skills

### dbt (analytics engineering)

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `using-dbt-for-analytics-engineering` | Build and modify dbt models, debug errors, explore data sources, write tests |
| `adding-dbt-unit-test` | Add unit tests for dbt models, practice test-driven development |
| `building-dbt-semantic-layer` | Create semantic models, metrics, and dimensions with MetricFlow |
| `answering-natural-language-questions-with-dbt` | Answer business questions by querying the semantic layer |
| `working-with-dbt-mesh` | Implement dbt Mesh governance (contracts, access, groups, versions) and cross-project collaboration |
| `troubleshooting-dbt-job-errors` | Diagnose and resolve dbt platform job failures |
| `configuring-dbt-mcp-server` | Set up the dbt MCP server for Claude, Cursor, or VS Code |
| `fetching-dbt-docs` | Look up dbt documentation efficiently |
| `running-dbt-commands` | Run dbt CLI commands with correct flags, selectors, and parameter formats |

### dbt-migration (one-off use)

These skills are typically used once during a migration project rather than in every agent session.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `migrating-dbt-core-to-fusion` | Migrate dbt projects from dbt Core to the Fusion engine |
| `migrating-dbt-project-across-platforms` | Migrate dbt projects across data platforms |

## Prerequisites

Most skills assume:

- dbt is installed and configured
- A dbt project with `dbt_project.yml` exists
- Basic familiarity with dbt concepts (models, tests, sources)

Some skills like `fetching-dbt-docs` and `configuring-dbt-mcp-server` can be used without an existing project.
